# loopextractor

A python scipt for extracting loops from audio files.

The script uses non-negative tensor factorization to model a version of the spectrum.

The code was written by Jordan B. L. Smith (@jblsmith) in December 2019.

### Usage

Calling loopextractor from the command line will run it on the included audio file as an example:

```
python loopextractor.py
```

You can also import it and use the functions in it on your own data:

```
import loopextractor
loopextractor.run_algorithm("my_audio_file.mp3", n_templates=[30,25,10], output_savename="my_string")
```

### Reference

The script implements the algorithm described in this paper:

### Disclaimer

Although the code for loopextractor follows the same steps described in the ICASSP paper cited above,
this code was written from scratch in December 2019 by Jordan Smith alone.
